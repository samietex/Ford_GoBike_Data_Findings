# Ford GoBike System Data Presentation
## by Samuel Shaibu


## Dataset

> In the San Francisco Bay Area of California, there is a regional public bike sharing program called Bay Wheels (formerly Ford GoBike). With approximately 500,000 rides since its debut in 2017, Bay Wheels is the first regional and extensive bicycle sharing system set up in California and along the West Coast of the United States. As of January 2018, it has about 10,000 annual subscribers. The monthly individual trip data for the broader San Francisco Bay area in CSV format from January 2018 to December 2018 comprise the dataset used for this exploratory investigation.

> Here are some data wrangling processes I took:

* Identified data issues regarding tidiness and quality
* Cleaned the data by making sure that the multiple fields have the correct data types.
* Added new columns
* Filter out outliers from some of the visuals 
* Plotted some visuals for communicating findings from the data


## Summary of Findings

> There were more trips on work days than on weekends. The number of journeys peaked between 8 and 9 am and 17 to 18 pm during the day. The summer season was the busiest time of the year, probably because of the climate. Compared to weekends, riding trips are often shorter from Monday through Friday. On typical workdays, it shows a very consistent and effective usage of the bike sharing system, whereas weekends show more informal, flexible use.

> Trip duration is highly dependent on the member's age; for those between 20 and 45, it is longer than for those who are older. Regarding age, duration, and gender, the others made their leaps when they were older (about 60 years old), resulting in a 3000 trip duration. Both the Customer and the Subscriber exhibit similar trends for age and trip duration, although the trip time for Subscribers is longer for older ages.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Subscribers' efficient/short periods of consumption are consistent with their high concentration during Monday through Friday rush hours, showing that the use is mostly for commuting to work. Customers clearly utilize the bike sharing system considerably differently than subscribers, frequently on weekends and in the afternoons, likely for leisure or city tours, as seen by the more flexible and lax pattern of their usage.

> We can also observe that there are lesser bike trips on weekends compared to weekdays. It also shows that the male gender have the highest number of bike trips between monday and friday.
