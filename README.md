## by Samuel Shaibu

## Dataset

> Bay Wheels (formerly Ford GoBike) is a regional public bike sharing program in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. Since its launch in 2017, Bay Wheels has recorded approximately 500,000 rides, making it the first extensive bicycle sharing system in California and along the West Coast of the United States. As of January 2018, it had around 10,000 annual subscribers. The dataset used for this exploratory investigation consists of monthly individual trip data in CSV format from January 2018 to December 2018, covering the broader San Francisco Bay area.

> Here are the data wrangling processes I performed:

* Identified and resolved issues related to data tidiness and quality.
* Ensured correct data types for multiple fields.
* Created new columns.
* Filtered out outliers from certain visualizations.
* Generated visualizations to communicate the findings from the data.

## Summary of Findings

> The analysis revealed that there were more bike trips on work days compared to weekends. The peak hours for rides were between 8-9 am and 5-6 pm, indicating a concentration during typical commuting times. The summer season experienced the highest activity, potentially due to favorable weather conditions. On weekdays, the trip durations were generally shorter compared to weekends. Weekdays showed a consistent and efficient usage pattern, while weekends exhibited more casual and flexible usage.

> Trip duration showed a strong correlation with the age of the members. Individuals between the ages of 20 and 45 had longer trip durations compared to older riders. Notably, riders in the "other" gender category showed a significant increase in trip duration when they reached around 60 years old, reaching approximately 3000 in duration. Both Customers and Subscribers exhibited similar trends in terms of age and trip duration, although Subscribers had longer trip durations for older age groups.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The analysis highlights the distinct usage patterns between Subscribers and Customers. Subscribers primarily use the bike sharing system for daily commuting, as evidenced by their concentrated usage during Monday to Friday rush hours. In contrast, Customers exhibit a more relaxed and flexible usage pattern, with a higher frequency of trips on weekends and in the afternoon, suggesting leisure or recreational purposes.

> Additionally, the analysis reveals a lower number of bike trips on weekends compared to weekdays. Furthermore, it shows that males have the highest number of bike trips from Monday to Friday, indicating a gender-based difference in usage patterns.
